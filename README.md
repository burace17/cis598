Election Forecasting
====================================

This is a platform that allows one to host their election forecasting algorithms. It provides a small backend API
which can be used to implement the forecasting algorithm and then the provided frontend will display its results.

A quick start guide is available in `docs/index.rst`. To build the HTML version of this, use the following commands:

```
cd docs
make html
```

Note that Sphinx must be installed for these commands to work.
